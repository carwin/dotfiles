* ~dotfiles~

These are my dotfiles. Nearly everything is configured via Emacs and the very handy ~org-babel-tangle~
feature from =ob.el=.

There have been many many complicated iterations of this configuration, over time, I expect the
relatively simple setup presented here to bloat as other features get cherry-picked back into the
setup.
